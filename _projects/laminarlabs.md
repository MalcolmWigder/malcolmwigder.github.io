  <h1>A Note on Laminar Labs</h1>

  <p> My friends and I started a business which enhances the maintanence of remotely operated machines. We found that current industry practice was very inefficient, so we started making a tool to fix it. It's going well.  </p>

  <p> I am sure that a big tech company could answer the problem in their own, very robust way. But I believe we can hyperfit to the customer's needs in a way they cannot. I also think we can work way faster. If you have stuff that breaks and is expensive to fix, lmk. </p>

  <p> I want to note that we all have prospects for when we graduate if it doesn't work out. Of course it would be nice if this thing took off, but it has been immensely rewarding either way. More than anything, it has been fun to work on. I hope to showcase the product here in due time. </p>
